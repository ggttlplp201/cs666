# CS2 Quant — Skin Trading Agents (Systems A & B)

Two independent trading agents on the CS2 skin market (BUFF163), sharing one knowledge layer, data layer, and signal bus.

- **System A — Event-Driven / Reactive** (Builder 1): trades game-update / balance-change repricings. Alpha = information.
- **System B — Positional Value / Trend** (Builder 2): accumulates undervalued items on structural factors. Alpha = factor edge + patience.

Start with `docs/Shared_Market-Fundamentals_Indicator-Library.md` and `docs/RESEARCH_INDEX.md`, then your system's doc.

**Why "shared + two" and not two separate folders:** A and B depend on the *same* Shared doc, papers, crash course, and infrastructure. Keeping one shared copy prevents drift (edit the Shared doc once, both systems see it) and keeps the docs' internal `/docs` and `/research/papers` links valid. The two-way split lives in `src/` (`system_a` / `system_b`).

## Who reads / edits what

| Artifact | Format | Audience | Editable? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `docs/*.md` | Markdown | **Claude Code** (canonical source) + humans | **Yes — edit these** |
| `docs/pdf/*.pdf` | PDF | humans (devs, stakeholders) | No — regenerate from md |
| `research/papers/*.pdf` | PDF | Claude Code + humans (reference) | No |
| `research/crash course.txt` | Text | Claude Code + humans (PRIMARY notes) | Rarely |
| `config/*.yaml` | YAML | code (runtime) + devs (tuning) | **Yes — the fast-adjust path** |
| `.env` | env | code only | Yes, never commit |

**Precedence reminder** (see `docs/RESEARCH_INDEX.md`): the crash-course notes + `docs/` are PRIMARY; the two papers are SECONDARY (corroboration + backlog to test). Notes win in live trading.

---

## Quick start per builder

**Both, once:** point Claude Code at the repo root so it reads `docs/` + `research/` before writing code. Fill `.env` and `config/shared.yaml` (fees, capital, data keys, execution path). See `HANDOFF.md`.

- **Builder 1 (System A):** work in `src/system_a` + `src/shared`. Read `docs/System-A_Event-Driven_Reactive.md`. Supply the rules-table content + social-monitor access (HANDOFF §A).
- **Builder 2 (System B):** work in `src/system_b` + `src/shared`. Read `docs/System-B_Positional_Value-Trend.md`. Supply factor weights + aesthetics scores + item universe (HANDOFF §B).

---

## Implementation status (Builder 1: shared + System A)

`src/shared/` and `src/system_a/` are implemented and tested (paper mode only).
Live data/execution stay disabled until the placeholder keys in `.env` are
replaced — see HANDOFF §0/§A for what's still human-supplied (rules-table
content, account allowlist, API keys).

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install pyyaml numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn pytest streamlit
.venv/bin/pytest                                        # test suite (186)
PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m system_a.runner --demo   # end-to-end paper demo
```

The demo synthesizes an M4A1-S nerf: monitor classifies the posts → signal
bus → rules table maps the substitute (M4A4) → right-side confirmation →
risk gate → paper buy → T+7 hold → take-profit exit, all provenance-logged
to `var/provenance_a.jsonl`.

## System A research dashboard (read-only)

### Running it locally (works on a fresh clone — no API keys needed)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggttlplp201/cs666.git && cd cs666
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install pyyaml numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn streamlit
make dashboard          # → opens http://localhost:8501
```

No `.env` is required — the dashboard is read-only and never touches secrets.
It renders from local data files that are **not in git** (`var/` is ignored):

- `var/market.db` — poller snapshots + Steam backtest history. **Without it,
  pages show "no poller data yet" placeholders** — that means missing data,
  not a broken install. Either copy `var/market.db` from the machine running
  the poller (ask Leon — single SQLite file, safe to share, contains no
  credentials), or generate your own history with a Steam session cookie:
  `PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m shared.steam_history`.
- `var/provenance_a.jsonl` — decision log for the Prediction Log page.
  `make demo` generates one from the synthetic paper demo in seconds.

If port 8501 is taken: `.venv/bin/streamlit run dashboard_a/app.py --server.port 8502`.
(No `make` on the machine? Run that same `streamlit run` command directly.)

### What each page answers

The dashboard cannot trade or change config — read-only by construction.

1. **Data health** — is the poller alive? Gaps in the series are loud (a
   silently broken poller is the failure mode we care most about).
2. **Live market** — current book per item: ask/bid, spread, depth, staleness.
3. **Spread analysis** — what trading costs: spread distribution + the
   spread-vs-liquidity relationship that killed reactive entry.
4. **Rule scorecard** — per-rule out-of-sample results and current gating
   (in-sample numbers are quarantined, never mixed in).
5. **Event timeline** — every labeled event, prediction vs realized, plus the
   live forward tests (2026-07-09 Cache/Armory).
6. **Prediction log** — browsable provenance: which signals fired, which rule
   decided, and why.

A persistent banner shows the operating mode (LOG-ONLY), spend to date ($0),
and how many rules are currently DO-NOT-TRADE.

## Regenerating the PDFs

The `.md` files are canonical; the PDFs in `docs/pdf/` are snapshots. After editing a doc, regenerate its PDF (e.g. `markdown` → HTML → `wkhtmltopdf`, or `pandoc`). Never edit the PDF directly.

---

## Reading order (new contributor / Claude Code)

1. `docs/Shared_Market-Fundamentals_Indicator-Library.md` — how the market works + governance (§12).
2. `docs/RESEARCH_INDEX.md` — what the papers add, and the notes-first precedence.
3. Your system doc (A or B).
4. `docs/System-B_Research-Notes.md` — Builder 2's 2026-07 research pass: verified venue
   facts (fee cut to 1.5%, T+7 seller-fund settlement, Armory mechanics), vendor due
   diligence (csmarketapi has NO BUFF163; volume history must be self-collected),
   paper number extraction, and the System B engine's build decisions.
5. `research/papers/paper1.pdf` / `paper2.pdf` — only when you need a specific method or number.

## System B engine (built)

`src/shared/` + `src/system_b/` contain Builder 2's engine: normalized data layer,
indicator library, regime classifier, T+7-aware ledger (item lock AND seller-fund
settlement), paper broker, honest walk-forward backtester, factor/accumulation-signal
strategy, risk gate, provenance journaling, synthetic market for key-less development,
and a daily paper-trading runner. See `src/system_b/README.md` for usage.
